 title = {Privilege Escalation Attacks on {A}ndroid},
 booktitle = {ISC'10: Proceedings of the 13th Information Security Conference},
 abstract = {Android is a modern and popular software platform for smart-
phones. Among its predominant features is an advanced security model
which is based on application-oriented mandatory access control and
sandboxing. This allows  developers and users to restrict the execution of
an application to the privileges it has (mandatorily) assigned at instal-
lation time. The exploitation of vulnerabilities in program code is hence
believed to be confined within the privilege boundaries of an application's
sandbox. However, in this paper we show that a privilege escalation at-
tack is possible. We show that a genuine application exploited at runtime
or a malicious application can escalate granted permissions. Our results
immediately imply that Android's security model cannot deal with a
transitive permission usage attack and Android's sandbox model fails as
a last resort against malware and sophisticated runtime attacks.},

That paper introduced Hoare Logic, which is still the basis for program verification today, but is now mechanised inside sophisticated verification systems. We aim here to give an accessible introduction to methods for proving Hoare formulae based both on the forward computation of postconditions and on the backward computation of preconditions. Although precondition methods are better known, computing postconditions provides a verification framework that encompasses methods ranging from symbolic execution to full deductive proof of correctness.},
