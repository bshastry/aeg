\section{Deliverables} \label{del}
One of the main goals of this project was to develop a framework that is capable of performing static analysis on C code. We believe our project takes this goal forward. We have a proof of concept static analysis framework that is capable of inferring simple relationships between program variables. The present framework has several limitations, namely, (1) It works for a limited subset of C language instructions and statements; prominently, pointers are not handled; (2) It does not work well for loops in general; we intend to make static analysis in the presence of loops more precise; (3) Finally, our framework is presently modeled on a simplistic constraint language consisting of boolean operators and the less than or equal to operator, $\le$; for instance, at each point in a C program, our framework keeps a track of constraints in a first-order logical formula consisting of logical operators $\neg$, $\land$, $\lor$, and the $\le$ arithmetic operator. Furthermore, we confine our analyis to linear arithmetic expressions (combination of $+$ and $\times$ operators on program variables and constants)
