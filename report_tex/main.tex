\begin{abstract}
Managing the security of complex systems poses a great challenge. Incremental software patches are by far the most common means of plugging security holes: be it at the level of the operating system kernel, the middleware or the applications.
However, the practice of system hardening via patch deployment assumes that the concerned patches are deployed uniformly across systems running a piece of software. This is far from reality: software vendors often stagger the deployment of patches for various reasons. 
This project is a step in the direction of building a static analysis framework that is able to analyse differences in code across multiple versions of a component in a large software system and provide as output, inputs to these components that might compromise security of the system. We choose the Android mobile platform as a case study where our framework could be put to test.
